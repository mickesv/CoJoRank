* Challenges
  - many lists are outdated
    - CORE Journals is from 2010
    - RFD not updated since 2014
    - Guide2Research uses CORE and QUALIS2012
    - GII-GRIN-SCIE Italian-Spanish aggregates from e.g. CORE
  - agreement between lists?
  - do we agree with their rankings?
* crossroads

Do we use existing rank-lists or a curated SERL-list

* Suggestion
t_0:
 - use NSD-Nordic List
   - It is active
   - It is curated
   - It lists Journals and Conferences published in a series (ISSN)
 - Seeding Workshop
   - search for favourite journal/conferences and check ranking to seed the SERL-rank-list.

t_n:
 - Need to Include Basis. When considering a venue:
   1. Is it already SERL-ranked? (Do we still agree?)
   2. If not, do we agree with the ranking from NSD-Nordic?
   3. If yes, add to SERL-rank.
   4. If no, collegial decision, add to SERL-rank.
* Examples
